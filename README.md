This project was about creating a back-end development database for St. Alphonsus primary school because previously they were using a pen and paper model which was very time consuming and inefficient. For this reason, the assignment was to create a web-based digital system, including a relational database to hold all the data digitally and make the system more efficient. Before making the database, an entity relationship diagram had to be made to not only describe the relationship between tables but to also get a preview of what the database would look like.
