St. Alphonsus Primary School Database Project

This project, undertaken as an assignment for a module during my bachelor's degree at University Academy 92, aimed to address the inefficiencies of the manual pen-and-paper model used by St. Alphonsus Primary School. The objective was to create a web-based digital system, including a relational database, to streamline operations and improve efficiency.

The assignment entailed:

Digital Transformation: Transitioning from a manual pen-and-paper model to a digital system to enhance efficiency and productivity.

Database Development: Designing and implementing a relational database to store all school-related data digitally.

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Creating an ERD to visualize and define the relationships between different entities within the database, providing a blueprint for the database structure.

By completing this project, the aim was to modernize the school's data management system, paving the way for smoother operations and improved productivity.
